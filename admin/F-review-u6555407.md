Review Comments:

1. Task 3 : Code is comprehensible and well commented.
2. Initialisation of variables such as countRed.. can be made syntactically sugar.
3. Naming of variable was good;Used names which can be related to meaningful stuffs and was in Camelcase.
   (followed java convention for naming variables)
4. At line 74 if(isPlacementWellFormed(items[i])!=true) could be altered into !isPlacementWellFormed(items[i])
5. The Last condition from line 104 can be better.The current codes will count all the number of pegs and then
   only will check if they are valid.It could have stopped check the number of pegs if the number of pegs exceed 
   the valid amount.
6. Overall the Implementation of Task 3 is well thought and good.
