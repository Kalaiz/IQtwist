I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method checkBoard2() in class TwistGame.
* The method RandomStart() in class Board.

* The idea of building 2-D String matrix to represent pieces and pegs came from a discussion with Kalaiarasan Somasundaram,

* The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
