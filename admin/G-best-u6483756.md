I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method getSolution() in class TwistGame.
* The method reorderPlacementStrings() in class TwistGame.
* The method combination() in class TwistGame.
* The method getFormalPieces() in class TwistGame.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <judging the solutions first then add into an arraylist> came from a discussion with <Hao Che>

* The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
